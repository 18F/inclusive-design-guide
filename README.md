18F Inclusive Design Guide
==========================

18F's guide for building inclusive and accessible digital products.

This guide will describe how 18F builds digital products to be inclusive and accessible in a user-centric way (ie, we can go much further than [Section 508](http://www.access-board.gov/guidelines-and-standards/communications-and-it/about-the-section-508-standards)). We hope to start from the work of others, such as [gov.uk's work](https://www.gov.uk/help/accessibility). We also hope this to be a practical guide that other government agencies can use.
